# instacartpython
This is a course project done for my Python for Datascience course at Rutgers university.
This project will analyze and predict future buying trend using past purchase behavior based on the datasets shared by Instacart, a US based same-day grocery delivery service. The goal of this project is to recommend an algorithm that will allow Instacart and other companies to analyze their transaction data and improve their product recommendation system. The results from this project could serve as a guideline for retailers in planning product recommendation strategy.
